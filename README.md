# Customer Churn Prediction Analysis Using Ensemble Techniques in Machine Learning

### Description:

Customers are a company's most valuable asset, and maintaining customers is critical for any organisation looking to increase revenue and develop long-term meaningful relationships with customers. Furthermore, the cost of obtaining a new client is five times that of keeping an
existing customer. Customer Churn/Attrition is one of the most well-known business difficulties in which consumers or subscribers discontinue doing business with a service or a firm. Ideally, they will no longer be a paying customer. A client is considered to have been churned if a certain length of time has passed since the consumer last interacted with the company. Identifying whether or not a client will churn and
offering relevant information aimed at customer retention are crucial to lowering churn. Our brains cannot anticipate customer turnover for millions of clients; here is where machine learning may assist.
